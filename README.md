# 2.8 Out of Core Computation

## Dependencies

Refer to the following markdown file for the respective sections of the class:

- [Self Studies](./studies.md)
- [Lesson](./lesson.md)
- [Assignment](./assignment.md)
- [Quiz](./quiz.md)
- [Reference](./reference.md)

## Lesson Objectives

Learners will understand:

- Out of core (memory) computation and dataframe concepts.

Learners will be able to:

- Use alternative dataframe libraries to Pandas for more performant and scalable data processing.
- Use DuckDB to query data that is too large to fit in memory.
