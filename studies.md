# Self Studies

## Brief

In this lesson, we will be learning about _out of core_ dataframe and data processing. We will use `Polars`, an alternative dataframe libraries to `Pandas` for more performant and scalable data processing. We will also use `DuckDB` to query data that is too large to fit in memory.

### Foundation

- Revisit and review the following materials:
  - Unit 1.7 - Introduction to Pandas
  - Unit 1.8 - EDA Basic
  - Unit 1.9 - EDA Advanced
- [Out of core data processing](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/data-doesnt-fit-in-memory/)

### Pandas' limitation

- [Pandas Memory Error](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-fix-memoryerror-issues-when-using-pandas-in-python/)
- [Pandas Multiprocessing](https://saturncloud.io/blog/pandas-multiprocessing-apply-a-guide-for-data-scientists/)
- [Pandas 2.0 vs Polars](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/high-performance-data-manipulation-in-python-pandas2-vs-polars)
